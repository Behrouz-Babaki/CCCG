 Running CCCG on examples
 ------------------------

 The minimum input that should be provided to CCCG is the coordinates
 of data objects, and the number of clusters:

 $ ./bin/cccg -d <DATAFILE> -k <#CLUSTERS>

 For example, you could run CCCG on iris dataset and ask it to find
 the optimal clustering consisting of three clusters. You could do so
 using the following command in CCCG home direcotry:

 $ ./bin/cccg -d ./examples/iris.data -k 3

 However, running exact algorithms for unconstrained clustering
 problems could take a lot of time. In contrast, the following
 constrained clustering problem converges to the optimal solution very
 quickly:

 $ ./bin/cccg -d ./examples/iris.data -k 3 -n ./examples/iris.constraints

 The command aobve, specifies that clustering constraints are stored
 in file iris.constraints.

 The performance of CCCG could be boosted if you provide it an initial
 solution:

 $  ./bin/cccg -d ./examples/iris.data -k 3 -n ./examples/iris.constraints -i ./examples/iris.initial

 You could also provide a set of initial solutions (clusterings) by
 specifying the directory where these solutions are stored:

 $ ./bin/cccg -d ./examples/iris.data -k 3 -n ./examples/iris.constraints -r ./examples/initial
